# Deep-Learning-4-Matrix-Based-Dense-NN

Creating a matrix based dense Neural Network. I used the backpropagation algorithm for training and testing on my dataset.
**np.dot does a dot product
My code uses the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm, (biases and wesights are updated after each input) and then I use mini Batch Gradient Descent to update W & B after each batch. 

Output:

*Training 100 Epochs*
